GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE!

This is the Lotus Engine. At least my version, if there are any other engines out there that are named that, I need to know so I can change the name.

### PURPOSE
I am developing this mainly because I can. I have studied a decent amount of Java and would like to work in the game development sector. I have no idea how game engines work, so I have started the Lotus Engine project.

### DISCLAIMER
**This is following a tutorial on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyKE7vz65rY&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE by GamesWithGabe). All credit to the code goes to them, but I am more in it to learn how it works. If this is an issue as well for any parties involved, please let me know and I will immediately remove it. 

I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH, THIS IS NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE, ONLY AS A LEARNING PROJECT FOR ME, AND FOR ME TO USE FOR MY OWN PERSONAL PROJECTS!!!**

### PROGRESS
As of writing, there is a basic shader engine set up, and that is about it. This project will be continued until it is done.

After I finish with this part, I will use the engine to program other projects (namely, Javamon).

#### Remarks
My only goal in this project is to learn how game engines work, how to program one, and a little more about how Java works. I love `C`, but Java will always have a special place in my heart, since I used it to annoy my professors while in college becuase aerospace engineers only know Python and MATLAB.

#### Enjoy looking through the Lotus Game Engine
